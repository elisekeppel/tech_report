##Study area: CM

Inbound and outbound shipping lanes – Swiftsure Bank to Vancouver  

6 km buffer on either side – provide a balance/trade-off between coverage of the Project area and a survey that could be completed in a reasonable amount of time each month 

Because of limitations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, transects were clipped to Canadian waters for surveys conducted in 2020 – Jan 2022. 

 

##Survey design: CM

Boat-based, multi-species cetacean surveys – use distance sampling methods 

Standard distance sampling methods assume that all portions of the study area have an equal prob. of being included in the sample (i.e equal coverage probability).  

Vessels travel along pre-determined systematic transect lines 

Perpendicular to depth gradients 

Designed to be analyzed as a single stratum with uniform coverage (*though can think about some post-stratification to compare to e.g. PRISMM estimates (interannual variation), Anna Hall surveys (trends? Changes?)) 

Used “dssd” (Distance sampling survey design) package in R 

Equal-spaced complementary zig zag design  

survey design covers both US and Canadian waters 

Complementary zig-zag design to minimize off-effort travel time 

Random start points; new iteration of transect lines generated for each survey 

Line spacing: 18 km 

1000 simulations  

Several line spacing options explored, coverage probability scores simulated for each using a truncation distance of 2 km * note that this should be discussed in results for porpoises as actual realized coverage was less than 2 km 

Further minimized off-effort travel time 

Mean number of transect lines: 40 (from simulations) 

Transect lines less than 1 km long were generally excluded from survey effort due to time constraints 

Same spacing used in this area during PRISMM surveys and Raincoast surveys (Thomas et al. 2010). 

Uniform coverage because of the multi-species nature of the surveys (i.e. different distributions/ densities, etc) 

Subdivided into 7 substrata for survey design purposes, due to non-convex shape 

Order/direction that transect lines were surveyed were determined based on weather and other research objectives and thus varied among surveys 

 

##Data collection: LS

Surveys conducted monthly when possible  

Limitations = weather, vessel availability 

Research vessel Manyberries traveled at a speed of approximately 10 knots while on-effort 

Time spent at speeds <5 knots/km/hr and >13(?) knots were excluded from analyses 

Survey observations generally conducted as described in D-V et al. (in press), though without the third (“big eye”) observer, as the size of the vessel did not have an appropriate platform to mount the Fujinon 25x150 MTM heavy-duty military binoculars. (*but that’s ok because we were close to shore… not a lot of unknown species) 

Group sizes/lumping/spltting? 

Generally, …
