original intention of 'surveys' was for each to be representative of the survey area

most months cover most of area

with this many rep's, should be able to capture average density, 
with some surveys missing areas with more hw's or less hw's

if not, then exclude non-representative surveys?

if combine surveys within season, end up with some areas covered more than others - 
may end up with other issue in abundance
(some areas still more represented than others)

dht2 - 1. code issues
2. is it doing what we think - ie. overall var (between years for each season)
as in the diagram for replicate strat'n
3. email for clarification first. in the way variance is being carried through - nonindep in det func var,
wonder whether det fun var is being calc'd sep by season/year, and is that applicable
when we're using a global detection function? and does it matter?

note assumptions in manuscript

check that O2 is still best - ie reduces er var
check that it makes sense that er var is higher with innes - why?
sure, nhat is higher than count for each transect going into er calc, but it's 
supposed to reduce er var so check
