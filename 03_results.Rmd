Line-transect surveys 

Map monthly/seasonal tracklines to date - Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun-, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec 

Clip by bath layer ~5m to eliminate the shallow areas never surveyable 

Include border 

Plots: 

Planned vs. Realized transects – seasonal 

(what are we missing seasonally?) 

Beaufort diff colours by 0-2, 3+ porpoise (maybe not for publication, but for our planning purposes 

Future planning map including survey area with US waters 

Simulate lines in US waters 

Coverage area by season projected forward including US waters 

Seasonal (to date) 

One for HWs, one for HP (with different detection distances) 

Simulate moving forward (2 more years of year-round survey effort) 

One species (HW and/or HP) - seasonal 

Compare 2 months – sequential? (showing how fast things could fluctuate) 

Compare 2 years (PRISMM? And/or Anna Hall’s data? And/or Raincoast?) 

Estimate total distance surveyed
