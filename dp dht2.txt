HW dht2() notes

tried running with strat = survey id, R2, innes=F

failed due to surveys with zero sightings in summer. try strat = year

year, R2, innes=F ran successfully

year, innes = F, effect of O2 (vs R2)
cv.ER O2 all dec
se & cv dec for each year, but total increases slightly... WHy?
(except fall, totals decrease slightly) HOW IS THIS TOTAL CALCULATED?
ER contrib all dec

year, O2, effect of innes = T
w cv.ER all inc, 
se & cv slight increase or same, same total,
ER contrib all inc

fall cv.ER all inc,
se & cv slight increase or same, same total,
ER contrib all inc

spring cv.ER all inc,
se & cv slight dec or inc, same total,
ER contrib all inc

summer cv.ER all inc,
se & cv slight increase or same, same total,
ER contrib all inc

looking at innes = T and R2 had even higher ER var contrib

Lowest ER var contribution seems to be year (cuz can't do survey id), O2, not innes
