EK outline notes:

METHODS:

Data management:
  - check for errors or missing data
  - calculate radial distance for reticle sgts using reticles, distance to horizon and hoe
  - land-based reticles...
  - calculate perp distance using radial distance (or estimated distance) and bearing
  - combine sighting, effort and gps data together for analysis
  
ANALYSIS:

Detection functions:
- data were analyzed using the R package "Distance" 
- try key function models for each species and examine histogram of detection probability against perpendicular sighting distance for appropriate truncation distance
- add in covariates (ie. environmental conditions, observer) and check for reduced delta AIC or improved model fit
- Continue in stepwise fashion, retaining covariates which improve fit, removing others from further analysis.

Abundance & Density:
- add study area into models to estimate abundance and density
